San Francisco Fire Department calls for service
-----------------------------------------------
The file size is approximately 1.4 GB and it contains approximately 4.35 million rows in 34 columns. The data includes all fire unitsâ€™ responses to calls. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involved multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with a block number, intersection or call box, not a specific address. The data schema is:Call Number
