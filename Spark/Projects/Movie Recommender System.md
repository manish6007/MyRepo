Group Lens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the Movie Lens web site. The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. The film industry has seen many technical changes over the years, making itself adaptable to its evolving audience's mentality and contributing to that evolution. Using movies ratings & reviews, both target audiences and public reviews, we have a glimpse into the change process. Any of these data points, once analysed, may contribute to greater business intelligence. After analysing the users’ ratings, based on ages, occupations etc. the movie makers can have better understanding about the viewers’ choice expectations which in turn is beneficial for marketing of their movies. This is done by determining the relationship between viewers and their ratings. Possible exploration ideas:
